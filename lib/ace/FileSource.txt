The originals of the ACE files used by GlowScript were found here:

https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/master/src
(At https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds are src-min, src-noconflict, and src-min-noconflict,
but we need the unminified form of the worker files in order to make changes shown below.
One can later minify the files if desired.)

The ACE files are imported by ide/index.html and used by the pages.edit section of ide/ide.js.

Small modifications to the ACE files for GlowScript purposes:

    In worker-javascript.js, disable giving an error for .1 as opposed to 0.1,
    because this is deemed to be an annoying and unnecessary style requirement.
    
    In worker-coffee.js, skip the header line ("GlowScript X.Y CoffeeScript").
    
 Search for GlowScript in these files to find the modifications.
 
 If the ACE files are updated, these modifications should be made.
 Note that between May 2011 and August 2012 there were significant
 changes to ACE which required different (simpler) modifications
 than had been made in 2011. This occurred again in 2014.

Currently, built files are at https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/
